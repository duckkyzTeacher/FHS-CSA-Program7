# Program 7

## Program Description:  
>In the heyday of the Dunder Mifflin empire, Scranton used a monetary system based on schrute-bucks, stanley-nickels, and klevins.
>
>There were 20 klevins to a schrute-buck, and 12 stanley-nickels to a klevin.
>
>The notation for this old system used two decimal points, so that, for example, $5.2.8 meant 5 schrute-bucks, 2 klevins and 8 stanley-nickels.
>
>The new monetary system introduced after Kevin was deposed, consists of only schrute-bucks and stanley-nickels, with 100 stanley-nickels to a schrute-buck.  We'll call this new system decimal schrute-buck.
>
>Thus $5.2.8 in the old notation is $5.13 in decimal schrute-bucks (actually $5.1333333).  

- Write a program to convert the old schrute-bucks stanley-nickels klevins format to decimal schrute-bucks.
